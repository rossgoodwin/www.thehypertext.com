				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been so busy the past two weeks that I failed to update this blog. But documentation is important, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going to take a moment to fill you in on all my recent activities. This post will cover all the projects I&#8217;ve been working on, primarily:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications Presentation on September 16</li>
<li>ITP Code Poetry Slam on November 14</li>
<li>The Mechanical Turk&#8217;s Ghost</li>
<li>Che55</li>
</ul>
<p>On Tuesday, September 16, I helped deliver a presentation to our class in Applications. Yingjie Bei, Rebecca Lieberman, and Supreet Mahanti were in my group, and we utilized <a title="Poetizer" href="http://www.thehypertext.com/2014/08/31/poetizer/" target="_blank">my Poetizer software</a> to create an interactive storytelling exercise for the entire audience. Sarah Rothberg was kind enough to record the presentation, and Rebecca posted it on Vimeo:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/106679005" width="610" height="343" frameborder="0" title="Group 3: Applications Presentation // Part 2" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been organizing an <a title="2014 ITP Code Poetry Slam" href="http://www.codeshakespeare.com" target="_blank">ITP Code Poetry Slam</a>, which will take place at 6:30pm on November 14. Submissions are now open, and I&#8217;m hoping the event will serve as a conduit for productive dialogue between the fields of poetry and computer science. Announcements regarding judges, special guests, and other details to come.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/egvgAG4"><img class="aligncenter" title="Code Shakespeare" src="http://i.imgur.com/egvgAG4.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Various explorations related to <a title="The Mechanical Turk's Ghost" href="http://www.thehypertext.com/2014/09/13/mechanical-turks-ghost/" target="_blank">the Mechanical Turk&#8217;s Ghost</a> [working title] have consumed the rest of my time. While I wait for all the electronic components I need to arrive, I have been focusing on the software aspects of the project, along with some general aspects of the hardware.</p>
<p>The first revision to the preliminary design I sketched out in <a title="The Mechanical Turk's Ghost" href="http://www.thehypertext.com/2014/09/13/mechanical-turks-ghost/" target="_blank">my prior post</a> resulted from <a title="Tony Kesich" href="http://kesi.ch" target="_blank">a friend</a>&#8216;s suggestion. Rather than using conductive pads on the board, I now plan to use Hall effect sensors mounted beneath the board that will react to tiny neodymium magnets embedded in each chess piece. If everything works properly, this design should be far less visible, and thus less intrusive to the overall experience. I ordered 100 sensors and 500 magnets, and I look forward to experimenting with them when they arrive.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the parts I listed in my prior post arrived, and I was especially excited to begin working with the Raspberry Pi. I formatted an 8GB SD card and put <a title="NOOBS" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/" target="_blank">NOOBS</a> on it, then booted up the Raspberry Pi and installed <a title="Raspbian" href="http://www.raspbian.org/" target="_blank">Raspbian</a>, a free operating system based on Debian Linux that is optimized for the Pi&#8217;s hardware.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/r_pi.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-185" src="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/r_pi-300x199.jpg" alt="r_pi" width="300" height="199" srcset="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/r_pi-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/r_pi-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/r_pi.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a title="Stockfish" href="http://stockfishchess.org/" target="_blank">Stockfish chess engine</a> will be a major component of this project, and I was concerned that its binaries would not compile on the Raspberry Pi. The makefile documentation listed a number of options for system architecture, none of which exactly matched the ARM v6 chip on the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-28-at-10.46.18-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-182 size-large" src="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-28-at-10.46.18-PM-906x1024.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-28 at 10.46.18 PM" width="610" height="689" srcset="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-28-at-10.46.18-PM-906x1024.png 906w, http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-28-at-10.46.18-PM-265x300.png 265w, http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-28-at-10.46.18-PM.png 1368w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></a>First, I tried the &#8220;ARMv7&#8221; option. The compiler ran for about 10 minutes before experiencing errors and failing. I then tried several other options, none of which worked. I was about to give up completely and resign myself to running the chess engine on my laptop, when I noticed the &#8220;profile-build&#8221; option. I had never heard of <a title="PGO" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization" target="_blank">profile-guided optimization</a> (PGO), but I tried using the command &#8220;make profile-build&#8221; rather than &#8220;make build&#8221; along with the option for unspecified 32-bit architecture. This combination allowed Stockfish to compile without any issues. Here is the command that I used (from the /Stockfish/src folder):</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">$ make profile-build ARCH=general-32</pre><p>With Stockfish successfully compiled on the Raspberry Pi, I copied the binary executable to the system path (so that I could script the engine using the <a title="Python Subprocess Library" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html" target="_blank">Python subprocess library</a>), then tried running <a title="ghost.py" href="https://github.com/rossgoodwin/mtg/blob/master/ghost.py" target="_blank">the Python script I wrote to control Stockfish</a>. It worked without any issues:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ghost.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-184 size-large" src="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ghost-1024x341.jpg" alt="ghost" width="610" height="203" srcset="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ghost-1024x341.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ghost-300x99.jpg 300w, http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ghost.jpg 1111w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>My next set of explorations revolved around the music component of the project. As I specified in my prior post, I want the device to generate music. I took some time to consider what type of music would be most appropriate, and settled on classical music as a starting point. Classical music is ideal because so many great works are in the public domain, and because so many serious chess players enjoy listening to it during play. (As anecdotal evidence, <a title="The Chess Forum" href="http://www.chessforum.com/" target="_blank">the Chess Forum</a> in Greenwich Village, a venue where chess players congregate to play at all hours of the day and night, plays nothing but classical music all the time. I have been speaking to one of the owners of the Chess Forum about demonstrating my prototype device there once it is constructed.)</p>
<p>Generating a classical music <a title="Mashup | Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music)" target="_blank">mashup</a> using data from the game in progress was the first idea I pursued. For this approach, I imagined that two classical music themes (one for black, one for white) could be combined in a way that reflected the relative strength of each side at any given point in the game. (A more complex approach might involve algorithmic music generation, but I am not ready to pursue that option just yet.) Before pursuing any prototyping or experimentation, I knew that the two themes would need to be suitably different (so as to distinguish one from the other) but also somewhat complementary in order to create a pleasant listening experience. A friend of mine who studies music suggested pairing one song (or symphony or concerto) in a major key with another song in the relative minor key.</p>
<p>Using <a title="YouTube Mixer" href="http://www.youtubemixer.net/" target="_blank">YouTube Mixer</a>, I was able to prototype the overall experience by fading back and forth between two songs. I started by pairing Beethoven&#8217;s Symphony No. 9 and Rachmaninoff&#8217;s Piano Concerto No. 3, and I was very satisfied with the results (play both these videos at once to hear the mashup):</p>
<p><iframe width="610" height="343" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/aFkAwFDZGHk?feature=oembed&#038;start=28" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><iframe width="610" height="458" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/t3217H8JppI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I then worked on creating a music mashup script to pair with my chess engine script. My requirements seemed very simple: I would need a script that could play two sound files at once and control their respective volume levels independently, based on the fluctuations in the score calculated by the chess engine. The script would also need to be able to run on the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>These requirements ended up being more difficult to fulfill than I anticipated. I explored many <a title="Python Audio Libraries" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonInMusic" target="_blank">Python audio libraries</a>, including <a title="pyo" href="http://code.google.com/p/pyo/" target="_blank">pyo</a>, <a title="pyfluidsynth" href="http://code.google.com/p/pyfluidsynth/" target="_blank">PyFluidSynth</a>, <a title="mingus" href="https://code.google.com/p/mingus/" target="_blank">mingus</a>, and <a title="pygame.mixer" href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html" target="_blank">pygame&#8217;s mixer module</a>. I also looked into using <a title="SoX" href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">SoX</a>, a command line audio utility, through the python subprocess library. Unfortunately, all of these options were either too complex or too simple to perform the required tasks.</p>
<p>Finally, on Gabe Weintraub&#8217;s suggestion, I looked into using Processing for my audio requirements and discovered a library called <a title="Minim" href="http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/" target="_blank">Minim</a> that could do everything I needed. I then wrote the following Processing sketch:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">import ddf.minim.*;

Minim minim1;
Minim minim2;
AudioPlayer player1;
AudioPlayer player2;

float gain1 = 0.0;
float gain2 = 0.0;
float tgtGain1 = 0.0;
float tgtGain2 = 0.0;
float level1 = 0.0;
float level2 = 0.0;
float lvlAdjust = 0.0;

BufferedReader reader;
String line;
float score = 0;

void setup() {
  minim1 = new Minim(this);
  minim2 = new Minim(this);
  player1 = minim1.loadFile("valkyries.mp3");
  player2 = minim2.loadFile("Rc3_1.mp3");
  player1.play();
  player1.setGain(-80.0);
  player2.play();
  player2.setGain(6.0);
}

void draw() {
  reader = createReader("score.txt");
  try {
    line = reader.readLine();
  } catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    line = null;
  }
  print(line); 
  score = float(line);
  
  level1 = (player1.left.level() + player1.right.level()) / 2;
  level2 = (player2.left.level() + player2.right.level()) / 2;  

  lvlAdjust = map(level1 - level2, -0.2, 0.2, -1, 1);
  tgtGain1 = map(score, -1000, 1000, -30, 6);
  tgtGain2 = map(score, 1000, -1000, -30, 6);
  tgtGain1 = tgtGain1 * (lvlAdjust + 1);
  tgtGain2 = tgtGain2 / (lvlAdjust + 1);
  
  gain1 = player1.getGain();
  gain2 = player2.getGain();
  
  print(' ');
  print(gain1);
  print(' ');
  print(gain2);
  print(' ');
  print(level1);
  print(' ');
  println(level2);
  
  if (level2 &gt; level1) {
    tgtGain2 -= 0.1;
  } else if (level1 &lt; level2) {
    tgtGain1 -= 0.1;
  }
  
  player1.setGain(tgtGain1);
  player2.setGain(tgtGain2);
}</pre><p>The script above reads score values from a file created by the Python script that controls the chess engine. The score values are then mapped to gain levels for each of the two tracks that are playing. I input a chess game move by move into the terminal, and the combination of scripts worked as intended by fading between the two songs based on the relative positions of white and black in the chess game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a broader issue with my overall approach became highly apparent: the dynamic qualities of each song overshadowed most of the volume changes that occurred as a result of the game. In other words, each song got louder and quieter at various points by itself, and that was more noticeable than the volume adjustments the script was making. I attempted to compensate for these natural volume changes by normalizing the volume of each song based on its relative level compared to the other song (see lines 42-45, 48-49, and 63-67 in the code above). This did not work as effectively as I hoped, and resulted in some very unpleasant sound distortions.</p>
<p>After conferring with my Automata instructor, <a title="Nick Yulman" href="http://nysoundworks.org/" target="_blank">Nick Yulman</a>,  I have decided to take an alternate approach. Rather than playing two complete tracks and fading between them, I plan to record stems (individual instrument recordings) using the relevant midi files, and then create loop tracks that will be triggered at various score thresholds. I am still in the process of exploring this approach and will provide a comprehensive update sometime in the near future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have been learning about using combinations of digital and analog inputs and outputs with the Arduino, and using various input sensors to control motors, servos, solenoids, and RGB LEDs:</p>

<p>In Introduction to Computational Media, we are learning about object oriented programming, and Dan Shiffman asked us to create a Processing sketch using classes and objects this week. As I prepare to create a physical chessboard, I thought it would be appropriate to make a software version to perform tests. <a title="Che55" href="https://github.com/rossgoodwin/che55" target="_blank">Che55</a> (which I named with 5&#8217;s as an homage to Processing&#8217;s original name, &#8220;<a title="Proce55ing" href="https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/FAQ#why-is-it-called-processing" target="_blank">Proce55ing</a>&#8220;) was the result.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/che55.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-195 size-large" src="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/che55-1024x1024.png" alt="che55" width="610" height="610" srcset="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/che55-1024x1024.png 1024w, http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/che55-290x290.png 290w, http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/che55-300x300.png 300w, http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/che55-50x50.png 50w, http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/che55.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>Che55 is a fully functional chess GUI, written in Processing. Only legal moves can be made, and special moves such as en passant, castling, and pawns reaching the end of the board have been accounted for. I plan to link Che55 with Stockfish in order to create chess visualizations and provide game analysis, and to prototype various elements of the Mechanical Turk&#8217;s Ghost, including the musical component. I left plenty of space around the board for additional GUI elements, which I&#8217;m currently working on implementing. All of the code is available <a title="Che55 | Github" href="https://github.com/rossgoodwin/che55" target="_blank">on Github</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot claim credit for the chess piece designs. Rather, I was inspired by an installation I saw at the New York MoMA two weeks ago called <a title="Thinking Machine 4" href="http://www.turbulence.org/spotlight/thinking/" target="_blank">Thinking Machine 4</a> by Martin Wattenberg and Marek Walczak (also written in Processing).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now. Stay tuned for new posts about each of these projects. I will try to keep this blog more regularly updated so there (hopefully) will be no need for future multi-project megaposts like this one. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Now, here are some of the best poems it has produced. This is only a small collection&#8230; I have literally thousands of poems like these:</p>
<p><code>1. by richmond<br />
i raised my knees supine on the granite<br />
steps of the human mind to correlate<br />
all its contents we live on a cold winter<br />
moony night it said that nothing ever<br />
happened so worry its all like golden<br />
of past puerility or past manhood and all<br />
i raised my knees supine on the granite<br />
crumble away batch will crumble but<br />
crumble away batch will crumble</p>
<p>2. and houses<br />
roads boulevard are as fugitive alas<br />
as the tears blister and start you shall love<br />
corrupt with your crooked heart it was late<br />
late in the afternoon and it was not<br />
meant that we were doing was right that we<br />
hoped to change because it was not meant that<br />
roads boulevard are as fugitive alas<br />
and the thought of such endless avenues<br />
and the thought of such endless avenues</p>
<p>3. upward lemon<br />
yellow his belly button bud of flesh and saw<br />
the dark universe yawning where the plot<br />
where the walls staring forms leaned out leaning<br />
the room the char come and go talking<br />
of michelangelo and indeed there<br />
will be time to get complicated messy<br />
yellow his belly button bud of flesh and saw<br />
cities have sprouted up along the floor<br />
cities have sprouted up along the floor</p>
<p>4. never really<br />
die it has no ending ill love you till<br />
china and africa meet and the sensation<br />
of pater to recreate the phrase structure<br />
and measure of poor man prose and stand<br />
before you dumb and intelligent<br />
and shaking with shame rejected yet profess<br />
out the time and if it rains a closed circuit</p>
<p>5. nymphs of<br />
depths infinity around the limp leaves<br />
waited for rain while the black planets roll<br />
without aim where they roll in their whirlpools<br />
strange dolphins and sea nymphs of depths eternity<br />
around the limp father of thou<br />
dreamy floating flower ugly and futile<br />
lean neck and shrieked with delight in for committing</p>
<p>6. with a<br />
dulcimer in a formulated phrase<br />
and when i count there are only you and<br />
i have seen the perpetual footman hold<br />
my coat and snicker and in the mountains<br />
in the wad but dry sterile thunder<br />
without rain there is one thing its a dream<br />
already ended nothing</p>
<p>7. me hitting<br />
the period and you know nothing do<br />
you think the emptiness of space which is<br />
the end grant to aristotle<br />
what we have lingered in the subway window<br />
jumped in limousines with the imaginary</p>
<p>8. party is<br />
stuck on a pin when i and i thought i<br />
was fishing in the middle things have had<br />
time to devise a face to meet the faces<br />
that you were there and alive in their hearts<br />
who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars</p>
<p>9. troubles me<br />
for i can connect nothing with nothing<br />
the broken fingernails of soil hands<br />
my citizenry humble people who expect<br />
null la la to carthage then i came<br />
to your metropolis walked market street singing</p>
<p>10. of them<br />
is being smeared on the far arctic isle<br />
oh great was the sin of my hands queen and<br />
her tribe courier stars doctor back from<br />
his hansen's disease and woe ships of pure air<br />
inconceivable for me to betray even<br />
the ism can disperse through the<br />
wall and i know this from staring at mountains</p>
<p>11. being depressed<br />
on a ledge halfway up the white hair of<br />
the intrinsic mind that these cockle of<br />
birth and death and back turn upward from the<br />
sky with monuments span the bay then up<br />
the mountain and the climbing party is<br />
stuck on a bare stage as the years in did<br />
khan a stately pleasure dome with caves</p>
<p>12. like the<br />
action of the high water mark that place<br />
where the action of the hoary primordial<br />
grove where the sun goes down and wept sweet thames<br />
run softly till i end my song sweet thames river<br />
run softly till i end my birdsong the river<br />
into the heart of the blind where mass and<br />
gravity bulk vast its centrifuge</p>
<p>13. cardboard boxes<br />
butt ends or other testimony<br />
of summertime nights the nymphs are departed<br />
sweet thames run softly for i have lived over<br />
my lives without number i have whirled with<br />
the fanciful idea of<br />
a toast and tea in the colonnade and<br />
went leaving no broken hearts who sang sweet</p>
<p>14. will show<br />
you fear in a cage and can see at the<br />
air murmur of maternal who are mad<br />
to talk mad to live mad to talk mad to<br />
be the first word of paradise lost on<br />
an empty page think of an animal<br />
is being tortured with electric while<br />
android pope this is the lady of situations</p>
<p>15. dear mrs<br />
enjoin her i bring the horoscope myself<br />
one must be drooping and shedding her dims<br />
on the final stanzas of gibberish<br />
who cooked rotten creature lung heart feet<br />
tail and tortillas dreaming of as i<br />
need be found in our true blissful essence<br />
of mind is pure machinery whose blood</p>
<p>16. in the<br />
form of my spirit and great is the merchant<br />
and this and this is early on years before<br />
the machinery of other things of things<br />
more foreign and more distant in space and in<br />
realms where the glass held up by standards wrought<br />
with vines from which a minute there is not<br />
even another individual who is herself<br />
clinically depressed person can not get<br />
straight you are thinking think i think we are<br />
efflorescence all sorts of shapes and smells and after<br />
that long kiss i near lost my intimation yes he<br />
said i blaspheme i cant bear to look at you<br />
and me would it have been the same you are<br />
behind bars you are in the earth at the<br />
romance of the wards of the king must die<br />
unheard in dim song of my hands queen and<br />
her only i cant bear to look so antique<br />
and her presence the monition of<br />
her heart but for her lips roses from the<br />
superhuman tomb</p>
<p>17. ate the<br />
lamb stew of the east pilgrim states and halls<br />
bickering with the thing that troubles me<br />
for i should have been the rats foot only<br />
year to year but at my back in a brown<br />
mantle hooded i do i shall wear white<br />
flannel trousers and walk the street danced on<br />
broken barefoot smashed record player records<br />
of nostalgic european high german<br />
jazz finished the whisky and threw up groaning<br />
into the middle sixties was a soft<br />
october night curled once about the sky<br />
a hat on a million times the fool i<br />
grow previous i grow old i shall wear the bottoms<br />
of my natural ecstasy whom i sit<br />
on her back o look in the sand if there<br />
were water we should voyage far the sciences<br />
each straining in its spore like the andalusian<br />
girls used or shall i at least pretend to<br />
be of use suave cautious and meticulous<br />
full of depressed affected role is coming</p>
<p>18. the sacred<br />
river ran on i saw your saints your zens<br />
athenians and though the west wind appear<br />
to harbor there not one pure dream of love<br />
the dictates of her aspect her indeterminate<br />
response to question her potency<br />
over sewer water and waters her power<br />
to to mortify to invest with lulu<br />
to render mad to incite<br />
gong o let not time deceive you you can<br />
not get drunk and you closing the book spread<br />
like an infective disease from city<br />
to metropolis from continent to continent<br />
barred out here attach there denounced<br />
by press and stump censured even by<br />
the eleemosynary spider or under<br />
seals broken by the hole in the ocean<br />
of mercator projection its in marshes<br />
faded stagnant pools in the colonnade<br />
and went on a bare stage as the writer<br />
as the writer has cursed the world</p>
<p>19. [untitled]<br />
shriek come the break of day being driven to<br />
madness with fright i have haunted the tombs<br />
of the wards of the low on whom assurance<br />
sits as a silk hat on a screen would it<br />
have been as often of the band and blew<br />
the suffering of the states naked<br />
mind for love was the color of television</p>
<p>20. regiments of<br />
fashion and the deep waters of the subway<br />
and were red eyed in the trench of the heterosexual<br />
dollar the one universal essence<br />
of purest poison lurked the very good<br />
and the dying and the lore of ocean<br />
blue green grey white or black smooth prance or<br />
mountainous that ocean is more ancient<br />
than the healthy then too still american<br />
television is full of high sentence<br />
but a bit dumb at times indeed almost<br />
ridiculous almost at times indeed<br />
almost nonsensical almost at times<br />
indeed almost idiotic almost<br />
at times indeed almost farcical<br />
almost at times indeed almost ridiculous<br />
almost at times the utter casualness<br />
and deep ignorance of it and in iowa<br />
i know this from staring at raft months<br />
on end they never quite shine and the tanked<br />
up clatter of the stability</p>
<p>21. no explanation<br />
no mix of words or euphony or memories<br />
can touch that sense of the globe its ubiquity<br />
as constituting percent of the true<br />
predator the great white shark of pain that<br />
here was literally take up away by something<br />
unnamed until only a void was left<br />
the knowledge that the hyades shall sing<br />
where flap the tatters of the skull who<br />
humourless protest overturned only<br />
one emblematic pingpong table resting<br />
briefly in returning class later truly<br />
bald except for a hundred visions and<br />
revisions which a golden peeped out another<br />
hid his eyes before his feet flowed up the<br />
earth take heed scraped and scraped look again at<br />
that time remembrance of a whole generation<br />
comes to a sea journey<br />
atone im with you in rockland where you<br />
scream in a long face its them pills i took<br />
to bring it off she said something</p>
