<p>Now, here are some of the best poems it has produced. This is only a small collection&#8230; I have literally thousands of poems like these:</p>
<p><code>1. by richmond<br />
i raised my knees supine on the granite<br />
steps of the human mind to correlate<br />
all its contents we live on a cold winter<br />
moony night it said that nothing ever<br />
happened so worry its all like golden<br />
of past puerility or past manhood and all<br />
i raised my knees supine on the granite<br />
crumble away batch will crumble but<br />
crumble away batch will crumble</p>
<p>2. and houses<br />
roads boulevard are as fugitive alas<br />
as the tears blister and start you shall love<br />
corrupt with your crooked heart it was late<br />
late in the afternoon and it was not<br />
meant that we were doing was right that we<br />
hoped to change because it was not meant that<br />
roads boulevard are as fugitive alas<br />
and the thought of such endless avenues<br />
and the thought of such endless avenues</p>
<p>3. upward lemon<br />
yellow his belly button bud of flesh and saw<br />
the dark universe yawning where the plot<br />
where the walls staring forms leaned out leaning<br />
the room the char come and go talking<br />
of michelangelo and indeed there<br />
will be time to get complicated messy<br />
yellow his belly button bud of flesh and saw<br />
cities have sprouted up along the floor<br />
cities have sprouted up along the floor</p>
<p>4. never really<br />
die it has no ending ill love you till<br />
china and africa meet and the sensation<br />
of pater to recreate the phrase structure<br />
and measure of poor man prose and stand<br />
before you dumb and intelligent<br />
and shaking with shame rejected yet profess<br />
out the time and if it rains a closed circuit</p>
<p>5. nymphs of<br />
depths infinity around the limp leaves<br />
waited for rain while the black planets roll<br />
without aim where they roll in their whirlpools<br />
strange dolphins and sea nymphs of depths eternity<br />
around the limp father of thou<br />
dreamy floating flower ugly and futile<br />
lean neck and shrieked with delight in for committing</p>
<p>6. with a<br />
dulcimer in a formulated phrase<br />
and when i count there are only you and<br />
i have seen the perpetual footman hold<br />
my coat and snicker and in the mountains<br />
in the wad but dry sterile thunder<br />
without rain there is one thing its a dream<br />
already ended nothing</p>
<p>7. me hitting<br />
the period and you know nothing do<br />
you think the emptiness of space which is<br />
the end grant to aristotle<br />
what we have lingered in the subway window<br />
jumped in limousines with the imaginary</p>
<p>8. party is<br />
stuck on a pin when i and i thought i<br />
was fishing in the middle things have had<br />
time to devise a face to meet the faces<br />
that you were there and alive in their hearts<br />
who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars</p>
<p>9. troubles me<br />
for i can connect nothing with nothing<br />
the broken fingernails of soil hands<br />
my citizenry humble people who expect<br />
null la la to carthage then i came<br />
to your metropolis walked market street singing</p>
<p>10. of them<br />
is being smeared on the far arctic isle<br />
oh great was the sin of my hands queen and<br />
her tribe courier stars doctor back from<br />
his hansen's disease and woe ships of pure air<br />
inconceivable for me to betray even<br />
the ism can disperse through the<br />
wall and i know this from staring at mountains</p>
<p>11. being depressed<br />
on a ledge halfway up the white hair of<br />
the intrinsic mind that these cockle of<br />
birth and death and back turn upward from the<br />
sky with monuments span the bay then up<br />
the mountain and the climbing party is<br />
stuck on a bare stage as the years in did<br />
khan a stately pleasure dome with caves</p>
<p>12. like the<br />
action of the high water mark that place<br />
where the action of the hoary primordial<br />
grove where the sun goes down and wept sweet thames<br />
run softly till i end my song sweet thames river<br />
run softly till i end my birdsong the river<br />
into the heart of the blind where mass and<br />
gravity bulk vast its centrifuge</p>
<p>13. cardboard boxes<br />
butt ends or other testimony<br />
of summertime nights the nymphs are departed<br />
sweet thames run softly for i have lived over<br />
my lives without number i have whirled with<br />
the fanciful idea of<br />
a toast and tea in the colonnade and<br />
went leaving no broken hearts who sang sweet</p>
<p>14. will show<br />
you fear in a cage and can see at the<br />
air murmur of maternal who are mad<br />
to talk mad to live mad to talk mad to<br />
be the first word of paradise lost on<br />
an empty page think of an animal<br />
is being tortured with electric while<br />
android pope this is the lady of situations</p>
<p>15. dear mrs<br />
enjoin her i bring the horoscope myself<br />
one must be drooping and shedding her dims<br />
on the final stanzas of gibberish<br />
who cooked rotten creature lung heart feet<br />
tail and tortillas dreaming of as i<br />
need be found in our true blissful essence<br />
of mind is pure machinery whose blood</p>
<p>16. in the<br />
form of my spirit and great is the merchant<br />
and this and this is early on years before<br />
the machinery of other things of things<br />
more foreign and more distant in space and in<br />
realms where the glass held up by standards wrought<br />
with vines from which a minute there is not<br />
even another individual who is herself<br />
clinically depressed person can not get<br />
straight you are thinking think i think we are<br />
efflorescence all sorts of shapes and smells and after<br />
that long kiss i near lost my intimation yes he<br />
said i blaspheme i cant bear to look at you<br />
and me would it have been the same you are<br />
behind bars you are in the earth at the<br />
romance of the wards of the king must die<br />
unheard in dim song of my hands queen and<br />
her only i cant bear to look so antique<br />
and her presence the monition of<br />
her heart but for her lips roses from the<br />
superhuman tomb</p>
<p>17. ate the<br />
lamb stew of the east pilgrim states and halls<br />
bickering with the thing that troubles me<br />
for i should have been the rats foot only<br />
year to year but at my back in a brown<br />
mantle hooded i do i shall wear white<br />
flannel trousers and walk the street danced on<br />
broken barefoot smashed record player records<br />
of nostalgic european high german<br />
jazz finished the whisky and threw up groaning<br />
into the middle sixties was a soft<br />
october night curled once about the sky<br />
a hat on a million times the fool i<br />
grow previous i grow old i shall wear the bottoms<br />
of my natural ecstasy whom i sit<br />
on her back o look in the sand if there<br />
were water we should voyage far the sciences<br />
each straining in its spore like the andalusian<br />
girls used or shall i at least pretend to<br />
be of use suave cautious and meticulous<br />
full of depressed affected role is coming</p>
<p>18. the sacred<br />
river ran on i saw your saints your zens<br />
athenians and though the west wind appear<br />
to harbor there not one pure dream of love<br />
the dictates of her aspect her indeterminate<br />
response to question her potency<br />
over sewer water and waters her power<br />
to to mortify to invest with lulu<br />
to render mad to incite<br />
gong o let not time deceive you you can<br />
not get drunk and you closing the book spread<br />
like an infective disease from city<br />
to metropolis from continent to continent<br />
barred out here attach there denounced<br />
by press and stump censured even by<br />
the eleemosynary spider or under<br />
seals broken by the hole in the ocean<br />
of mercator projection its in marshes<br />
faded stagnant pools in the colonnade<br />
and went on a bare stage as the writer<br />
as the writer has cursed the world</p>
<p>19. [untitled]<br />
shriek come the break of day being driven to<br />
madness with fright i have haunted the tombs<br />
of the wards of the low on whom assurance<br />
sits as a silk hat on a screen would it<br />
have been as often of the band and blew<br />
the suffering of the states naked<br />
mind for love was the color of television</p>
<p>20. regiments of<br />
fashion and the deep waters of the subway<br />
and were red eyed in the trench of the heterosexual<br />
dollar the one universal essence<br />
of purest poison lurked the very good<br />
and the dying and the lore of ocean<br />
blue green grey white or black smooth prance or<br />
mountainous that ocean is more ancient<br />
than the healthy then too still american<br />
television is full of high sentence<br />
but a bit dumb at times indeed almost<br />
ridiculous almost at times indeed<br />
almost nonsensical almost at times<br />
indeed almost idiotic almost<br />
at times indeed almost farcical<br />
almost at times indeed almost ridiculous<br />
almost at times the utter casualness<br />
and deep ignorance of it and in iowa<br />
i know this from staring at raft months<br />
on end they never quite shine and the tanked<br />
up clatter of the stability</p>
<p>21. no explanation<br />
no mix of words or euphony or memories<br />
can touch that sense of the globe its ubiquity<br />
as constituting percent of the true<br />
predator the great white shark of pain that<br />
here was literally take up away by something<br />
unnamed until only a void was left<br />
the knowledge that the hyades shall sing<br />
where flap the tatters of the skull who<br />
humourless protest overturned only<br />
one emblematic pingpong table resting<br />
briefly in returning class later truly<br />
bald except for a hundred visions and<br />
revisions which a golden peeped out another<br />
hid his eyes before his feet flowed up the<br />
earth take heed scraped and scraped look again at<br />
that time remembrance of a whole generation<br />
comes to a sea journey<br />
atone im with you in rockland where you<br />
scream in a long face its them pills i took<br />
to bring it off she said something</p>
<p>22. their wrists<br />
three fourth dimension successively unsuccessfully<br />
gave up all for what everything comes down<br />
to the three old of fate the one eyeball of<br />
the blind where mass and gravity bulk brobdingnagian</code></p>
