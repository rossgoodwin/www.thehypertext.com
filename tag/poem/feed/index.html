<p>Several months ago, I asked the question above. On November 14, 2014, I believe <a title="Who Is Code Shakespeare?" href="http://www.codeshakespeare.com" target="_blank">the first ITP Code Poetry Slam</a> may have brought us closer to an answer.</p>
<p>In all the bustle of final projects being due in the past month, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to post anything about the code poetry slam I organized in November. Needless to say, the event was an enormous success, thanks mostly to the incredible judges and presenters. I hope to organize another one in 2015.</p>
<p>The judges brought a wealth of experience from a variety of different fields, which provided for some extraordinary discussion. They were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Bob Holman" href="http://www.bobholman.com/" target="_blank">Bob Holman</a></li>
<li><a title="Nick Montfort" href="http://nickm.com/" target="_blank">Nick Montfort</a></li>
<li><a title="Allison Parrish" href="http://www.decontextualize.com/" target="_blank">Allison Parrish</a></li>
<li><a title="Daniel Shiffman" href="http://shiffman.net/" target="_blank">Daniel Shiffman</a> (in absentia)</li>
</ul>
<p>This was the schedule for the slam, as written by me on the whiteboard wall of room 50 at ITP:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/whiteboard.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-383 size-medium" src="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/whiteboard-300x240.jpg" alt="whiteboard" width="300" height="240" srcset="http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/whiteboard-300x240.jpg 300w, http://www.thehypertext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/whiteboard.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><a title="Wikipoet" href="https://github.com/rossgoodwin/wikipoet" target="_blank">Wikipoet</a> is a program I wrote in Python that generates simple, iterative poems using the raw text from Wikipedia articles (retrieved via the <a title="MediaWiki API" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page" target="_blank">MediaWiki API</a>) and <a title="NLTK" href="http://www.nltk.org" target="_blank">NLTK</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Wikipoet" href="https://github.com/rossgoodwin/wikipoet" target="_blank">Wikipoet</a> is a program I wrote in Python that generates simple, iterative poems using the raw text from Wikipedia articles (retrieved via the <a title="MediaWiki API" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page" target="_blank">MediaWiki API</a>) and <a title="NLTK" href="http://www.nltk.org" target="_blank">NLTK</a>.</p>
<p>Wikipoet begins with a single word and uses the Wikipedia article for that word to find likely noun and adjective combinations. It then prints a stanza with the following structure:</p>
<p><code>[word]<br />
[adjective] [word]<br />
[adjective], [adjective] [word]<br />
[adjective], [adjective], [adjective] [word]<br />
[adjective], [adjective], [adjective], [adjective] [word]<br />
[word] [noun], [word] [noun], [word] [noun]<br />
[word] [noun], [word] [noun], [word] [noun]<br />
[word] [noun / new word]<br />
[new word]</code></p>
<p>Wikipoet then repeats this operation for the new word. The stanzas can continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><code>computer<br />
former computer<br />
flash, military computer<br />
many, full, best computer<br />
all, later, more, earlier computer<br />
computer design, computer help, computer say<br />
computer reference, computer voice, computer central processing unit<br />
computer job<br />
job<br />
principal job<br />
risky, creative job<br />
critical, national, many job<br />
lowly, steady, poor, primary job<br />
job satisfaction, job reference, job preparation<br />
job system, job look, job retention<br />
job want<br />
want<br />
noble want<br />
four, like want<br />
more, strong, most want<br />
human, some, american, many want<br />
want can, want production, want protection<br />
want level, want story, want item<br />
want character<br />
character<br />
classical character<br />
novel, new character<br />
other, written, first character<br />

year high</code></p>
<p>Depending on the length of the poem desired and the speed of one&#8217;s internet connection, Wikipoet can take a relatively long time to produce its output. The poem above took approximately 30 minutes to produce with a standard broadband connection.</p>
<p>While creating Wikipoet, I realized that I could improve the quality of its adjective-noun pairings by producing one set of adjective-noun combinations, then searching those combinations and removing ones that appear fewer than 10 times in Wikipedia search results.</p>
<p>Here is the code that accomplishes that using the MediaWiki API and the Python <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/" title="Requests" target="_blank">Requests</a> library, where y is a list of adjectives:</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">for i in y[:]:
    search_string = "\"" + i + ' ' + word + "\""
    payload = {'action': 'query', 'list': 'search',
               'format': 'json', 'srsearch': search_string, 
               'srlimit': 1, 'srprop': 'snippet',
               'srwhat': 'text'}
    r = s.get(url, params=payload, headers=headers)
    json_obj = r.json()
    hits = int(json_obj['query']['searchinfo']['totalhits'])
    if hits &lt; 10:
        y.remove(i)
    else:
        pass</pre><p> </p>
<p>The primary utility of Wikipoet is its ability to find meaningful adjectives to pair with nouns and nouns to pair with adjectives. I plan to integrate this process into future projects.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought I&#8217;d share a few more computer poems with you. But first, a new video:</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/104888885" width="610" height="343" frameborder="0" title="Another Poetizer.py + Poemreader.py Demonstration" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="http://www.thehypertext.com/2014/08/31/poetizer/" title="Poetizer" target="_blank">my previous blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>Now, here are some of the best poems it has produced. This is only a small collection&#8230; I have literally thousands of poems like these:</p>
<p><code>1. by richmond<br />
i raised my knees supine on the granite<br />
steps of the human mind to correlate<br />
all its contents we live on a cold winter<br />
moony night it said that nothing ever<br />
happened so worry its all like golden<br />
of past puerility or past manhood and all<br />
i raised my knees supine on the granite<br />
crumble away batch will crumble but<br />
crumble away batch will crumble</p>
<p>2. and houses<br />
roads boulevard are as fugitive alas<br />
as the tears blister and start you shall love<br />
corrupt with your crooked heart it was late<br />
late in the afternoon and it was not<br />
meant that we were doing was right that we<br />
hoped to change because it was not meant that<br />
roads boulevard are as fugitive alas<br />
and the thought of such endless avenues<br />
and the thought of such endless avenues</p>
<p>3. upward lemon<br />
yellow his belly button bud of flesh and saw<br />
the dark universe yawning where the plot<br />
where the walls staring forms leaned out leaning<br />
the room the char come and go talking<br />
of michelangelo and indeed there<br />
will be time to get complicated messy<br />
yellow his belly button bud of flesh and saw<br />
cities have sprouted up along the floor<br />
cities have sprouted up along the floor</p>
<p>4. never really<br />
die it has no ending ill love you till<br />
china and africa meet and the sensation<br />
of pater to recreate the phrase structure<br />
and measure of poor man prose and stand<br />
before you dumb and intelligent<br />
and shaking with shame rejected yet profess<br />
out the time and if it rains a closed circuit</p>
<p>5. nymphs of<br />
depths infinity around the limp leaves<br />
waited for rain while the black planets roll<br />
without aim where they roll in their whirlpools<br />
strange dolphins and sea nymphs of depths eternity<br />
around the limp father of thou<br />
dreamy floating flower ugly and futile<br />
lean neck and shrieked with delight in for committing</p>
<p>6. with a<br />
dulcimer in a formulated phrase<br />
and when i count there are only you and<br />
i have seen the perpetual footman hold<br />
my coat and snicker and in the mountains<br />
in the wad but dry sterile thunder<br />
without rain there is one thing its a dream<br />
already ended nothing</p>
<p>7. me hitting<br />
the period and you know nothing do<br />
you think the emptiness of space which is<br />
the end grant to aristotle<br />
what we have lingered in the subway window<br />
jumped in limousines with the imaginary</p>
<p>8. party is<br />
stuck on a pin when i and i thought i<br />
was fishing in the middle things have had<br />
time to devise a face to meet the faces<br />
that you were there and alive in their hearts<br />
who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars</p>
<p>9. troubles me<br />
for i can connect nothing with nothing<br />
the broken fingernails of soil hands<br />
my citizenry humble people who expect<br />
null la la to carthage then i came<br />
to your metropolis walked market street singing</p>
<p>10. of them<br />
is being smeared on the far arctic isle<br />
oh great was the sin of my hands queen and<br />
her tribe courier stars doctor back from<br />
his hansen's disease and woe ships of pure air<br />
inconceivable for me to betray even<br />
the ism can disperse through the<br />
wall and i know this from staring at mountains</p>
<p>11. being depressed<br />
on a ledge halfway up the white hair of<br />
the intrinsic mind that these cockle of<br />
birth and death and back turn upward from the<br />
sky with monuments span the bay then up<br />
the mountain and the climbing party is<br />
stuck on a bare stage as the years in did<br />
khan a stately pleasure dome with caves</p>
<p>12. like the<br />
action of the high water mark that place<br />
where the action of the hoary primordial<br />
grove where the sun goes down and wept sweet thames<br />
run softly till i end my song sweet thames river<br />
run softly till i end my birdsong the river<br />
into the heart of the blind where mass and<br />
gravity bulk vast its centrifuge</p>
<p>13. cardboard boxes<br />
butt ends or other testimony<br />
of summertime nights the nymphs are departed<br />
sweet thames run softly for i have lived over<br />
my lives without number i have whirled with<br />
the fanciful idea of<br />
a toast and tea in the colonnade and<br />
went leaving no broken hearts who sang sweet</p>
<p>14. will show<br />
you fear in a cage and can see at the<br />
air murmur of maternal who are mad<br />
to talk mad to live mad to talk mad to<br />
be the first word of paradise lost on<br />
an empty page think of an animal<br />
is being tortured with electric while<br />
android pope this is the lady of situations</p>
<p>15. dear mrs<br />
enjoin her i bring the horoscope myself<br />
one must be drooping and shedding her dims<br />
on the final stanzas of gibberish<br />
who cooked rotten creature lung heart feet<br />
tail and tortillas dreaming of as i<br />
need be found in our true blissful essence<br />
of mind is pure machinery whose blood</p>
<p>16. in the<br />
form of my spirit and great is the merchant<br />
and this and this is early on years before<br />
the machinery of other things of things<br />
more foreign and more distant in space and in<br />
realms where the glass held up by standards wrought<br />
with vines from which a minute there is not<br />
even another individual who is herself<br />
clinically depressed person can not get<br />
straight you are thinking think i think we are<br />
efflorescence all sorts of shapes and smells and after<br />
that long kiss i near lost my intimation yes he<br />
said i blaspheme i cant bear to look at you<br />
and me would it have been the same you are<br />
behind bars you are in the earth at the<br />
romance of the wards of the king must die<br />
unheard in dim song of my hands queen and<br />
her only i cant bear to look so antique<br />
and her presence the monition of<br />
her heart but for her lips roses from the<br />
superhuman tomb</p>
<p>17. ate the<br />
lamb stew of the east pilgrim states and halls<br />
bickering with the thing that troubles me<br />
for i should have been the rats foot only<br />
year to year but at my back in a brown<br />
mantle hooded i do i shall wear white<br />
flannel trousers and walk the street danced on<br />
broken barefoot smashed record player records<br />
of nostalgic european high german<br />
jazz finished the whisky and threw up groaning<br />
into the middle sixties was a soft<br />
october night curled once about the sky<br />
a hat on a million times the fool i<br />
grow previous i grow old i shall wear the bottoms<br />
of my natural ecstasy whom i sit<br />
on her back o look in the sand if there<br />
were water we should voyage far the sciences<br />
each straining in its spore like the andalusian<br />
girls used or shall i at least pretend to<br />
be of use suave cautious and meticulous<br />
full of depressed affected role is coming</p>
<p>18. the sacred<br />
river ran on i saw your saints your zens<br />
athenians and though the west wind appear<br />
to harbor there not one pure dream of love<br />
the dictates of her aspect her indeterminate<br />
response to question her potency<br />
over sewer water and waters her power<br />
to to mortify to invest with lulu<br />
to render mad to incite<br />
gong o let not time deceive you you can<br />
not get drunk and you closing the book spread<br />
like an infective disease from city<br />
to metropolis from continent to continent<br />
barred out here attach there denounced<br />
by press and stump censured even by<br />
the eleemosynary spider or under<br />
seals broken by the hole in the ocean<br />
of mercator projection its in marshes<br />
faded stagnant pools in the colonnade<br />
and went on a bare stage as the writer<br />
as the writer has cursed the world</p>
<p>19. [untitled]<br />
shriek come the break of day being driven to<br />
madness with fright i have haunted the tombs<br />
of the wards of the low on whom assurance<br />
sits as a silk hat on a screen would it<br />
have been as often of the band and blew<br />
the suffering of the states naked<br />
mind for love was the color of television</p>
<p>20. regiments of<br />
fashion and the deep waters of the subway<br />
and were red eyed in the trench of the heterosexual<br />
dollar the one universal essence<br />
of purest poison lurked the very good<br />
and the dying and the lore of ocean<br />
blue green grey white or black smooth prance or<br />
mountainous that ocean is more ancient<br />
than the healthy then too still american<br />
television is full of high sentence<br />
but a bit dumb at times indeed almost<br />
ridiculous almost at times indeed<br />
almost nonsensical almost at times<br />
indeed almost idiotic almost<br />
at times indeed almost farcical<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two days before ITP begins, and this is what I&#8217;m currently working on: computer generated poetry, read by a computer and accompanied by computer-selected images related to the text.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/104833442" width="610" height="343" frameborder="0" title="Poetizer.py + Poemreader.py" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I call it <a title="Poetizer" href="https://github.com/rossgoodwin/poetizer" target="_blank">Poetizer</a>, I coded it in Python, and it works with any text corpus. It&#8217;s also modular, so you can use the poetry-reading (poemreader.py) parts and poetry-writing parts (poetizer.py) separately to generate derivative works.</p>
<p>All of this started with <a title="Sonnetizer" href="http://rossgoodwin.com/sonnetizer" target="_blank">Sonnetizer</a>, a computer program I wrote that generates sonnets from any text corpus in (mostly) iambic pentameter using Ngram-based natural language generation (via <a title="Natural Language Toolkit" href="http://www.nltk.org" target="_blank">NLTK</a>) along with rhyming and metrical rules. You can view <a title="Sonnetizer" href="https://github.com/rossgoodwin/sonnetizer" target="_blank">the code on GitHub</a> or check out <a title="Ten Thousand Sonnets" href="http://rossgoodwin.com/10000sonnets.pdf" target="_blank">this book of 10,000 sonnets</a> (warning: 5000-page PDF) generated from the sonnets of William Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Sonnetizer was my first major Python project, and building it taught me a lot about Python. However, after building it and letting it sit for a month or so, I began to think about ways I might improve it.</p>
<p><a title="Poetizer.py" href="https://github.com/rossgoodwin/poetizer" target="_blank">Poetizer.py</a> is the result of that process. It involves user inputs such as rhyme scheme and desired poetic structure to allow for interactive poetry generation.</p>
<p><a title="Poemreader.py" href="https://github.com/rossgoodwin/poetizer" target="_blank">Poemreader.py</a> reads poems using built-in text-to-speech utilities present on Mac and Linux machines. It also displays images, gathered via Flickr API, related to the words in each poem it reads.</p>
<p><a title="Main.py" href="https://github.com/rossgoodwin/poetizer" target="_blank">Main.py</a> is a combination of the two files, tuned to produce a distinct interactive poetry experience. (This is the script running in the video above.)</p>
